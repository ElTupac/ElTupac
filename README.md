<h3>A junior programmer from Argentina</h3>

    **Working with Javascript**, testing and doing lot of fun things in my free time.\n
    I started learning C in highSchool, used it a lot for doing electronic stuff, but too slow to develop something with my anxious and nervous head. Love C and sometimes i practice with it in order to not lose all that knowledge.\n
    Currently using Javascript for the most of my projects and teaching it at **CoderHouse**.
